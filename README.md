## Executive Summary
This project builds a SQL-driven analytics system to monitor and optimize the credit card portfolio for **XYZ Bank** (UAE HQ, operating across 7 countries). It analyzes spend behavior, channel and timing patterns, segment contribution, fraud (frequency vs value), rewards effectiveness, and profitability—then converts findings into clear business actions.

### Portfolio snapshot (from this project)
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Customers (unique) | **10,000** |
| Cards issued | **51,598** |
| Total Spend (USD) | **$508.31M** |
| Avg Monthly Spend (USD) | **$21.18M** |
| Time Window | **Jan 2024 → Dec 2025** |
| Fraud Rate (overall) | **0.257%** |
| Geographies | **India, UAE, UK, Europe, Turkey, Qatar** |

## Business Problem
Banks need reliable portfolio insights to make data-driven decisions on:
- **Revenue growth** (category strategy, channel strategy, campaign timing).
- **Risk reduction** (fraud concentration by segment/category/channel; minimizing customer friction).
- **Rewards economics** (cashback cost control; value-based rewards).
- **Profitability & retention** (protect high-value cohorts; manage loss-making customers).

## Methodology
1. **Synthetic data generation (Python):** Multi-country portfolio behavior with realistic patterns (categories, channels, weekend bias, fraud injection, rewards redemptions).
2. **Database design (PostgreSQL):** Normalized schema and analytics-ready structure.
3. **Data validation (SQL):** Sanity checks (duplicates, missing values, referential integrity, fraud rate checks).
4. **Analytics layer (SQL):** Summary outputs for spend, segmentation, Pareto concentration, fraud, rewards, and profitability.
5. **Visualization (Power BI):** Dashboard built on validated SQL outputs + documentation in Markdown.

## Results & Business Recommendation
### Results (high level)
- Spend is concentrated in everyday categories (largest pools: **Groceries, Shopping, Fuel**).
- Channel behavior shows a **digital-first portfolio by spend value** (online spend dominates).
- Spend is strongly **weekend-skewed**, making timing a key lever.
- Spend concentration is meaningful: **Top 20% customers contribute 57% of total spend**.
- Fraud differs by segment in **frequency vs value**, requiring segmented controls.
- Cashback dominates reward redemptions, making it the primary cost lever.

### Business recommendations (high level)
- Growth: prioritize top spend categories, execute digital-first, and schedule major campaigns around weekends.
- Segments: apply segment-led strategy (Emerging Affluent retention/upsell; Mass Market scale + stable digital experience; Low Value activation + automation-first risk).
- Fraud: separate controls for frequent fraud pockets vs high-severity exposure, while minimizing friction for top spenders.
- Rewards: move toward value-based tiering/thresholds and monitor reward-to-spend patterns to reduce leakage.
